```{r, include = FALSE}

  collapse = TRUE,

  fig.path = "man/figures/README-",
  out.width = "100%"
)
```

Pipe into a sequence of calls without repeating the pipe symbol.

This is inspired by Stefan Bache and Hadley Wickham's *magrittr* pipe and behaves consistently, though it doesn't use its code. 

The approach of *nakedpipe* spares typing and visual space, the package also
proposes some convenient logging and debugging features and is a bit more
performant than its dressed counterpart.

Install with :

``` r
remotes::install_github("moodymudskipper/nakedpipe")
```

## Examples

```{r}
library(nakedpipe)
```

Pipe into a sequence of calls using `%.%`

```{r}
cars %.% {
 head(2)
 transform(time = dist/speed)
}
```

It plays well with left to right assignment

```{r}
cars %.% {
 head(2)
 transform(time = dist/speed)
} -> res
```

Use `~~` for side effects

```{r}
cars %.% {
 head(2)
 ~~ message("nrow:", nrow(.))
 transform(time = dist/speed)
}
```

This include assignments

```{r}
cars %.% {
 head(2)
 ~~ cars_h <- .
 transform(time = dist/speed)
}
cars_h
```

Assign in place using `%<.%`

```{r}
cars_copy <- cars
cars_copy %<.% {
 head(2)
 ~~ message("nrow:", nrow(.))
 transform(time = dist/speed)
}
cars_copy
```

Clock each step using `%L.%`

```{r}
cars %L.% {
 head(2)
 ~~ Sys.sleep(1)
 transform(time = dist/speed)
}
```

`%..%` is faster at the cost of using explicit dots

```{r}
cars %..% {
 head(.,2)
 transform(.,time = dist/speed)
}
```

It is better suited for programming and doesn't support side effect notation
but you can do :

```{r}
cars %..% {
 head(.,2)
  {message("nrow:", nrow(.)); .}
 transform(.,time = dist/speed)
}
```

## Debugging

The `%D.%` pipe allows you to step through the calls one by one.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Debug the pipe using `%D.%`
cars %D.% {
 head(2)
 transform(time = dist/speed)
}
```

You could also inster a browser() call as a side effect at a chosen step.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Debug the pipe using `%D.%`
cars %D.% {
 head(2)
 ~~ browser()
 transform(time = dist/speed)
}
```

## *ggplot2*

It's a little known trick that you can use *magrittr*'s pipe with *ggplot2* if you pipe
to the `+` symbol. It is convenient if you want to use the ggplot object
as the input of another function without intermediate variables of bracket
overload :

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
path <- tempfile()
cars %>%
  head() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(speed, dist)) %>%
  + geom_point() %>%
  + ggtitle("head(cars)") %>%
  saveRDS(path)

# rather than 
plt <- cars %>%
  head() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(speed, dist)) + 
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("head(cars)")
saveRDS(plt, path)
```

The former case above shows operators on both sides, which looks a bit complicated,
the latter requires a temporary variable and we must look at the end of the
previous line to know what kind of piping was done.

In both cases additionally if I chose to comment out the `ggtitle("head(cars)")` line, I should
also comment the last operator at the end of the previous line.

With *nakedpipe* we can write :

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cars %.% {
  head()
  ggplot(aes(speed, dist))
  + geom_point()
  + ggtitle("head(cars)")
  saveRDS(path)
}
```

`+` signs are neatly alligned, it's obvious where the *ggplot* chain starts and
ends, and trivial to pipe it to another instruction or to comment a line.

## Benchmark

We're a bit faster than *magrittr*, if you want to be even faster use `%..%` with
explicit dots, though keep in mind these are micro seconds and that the fastest
solution is always not to use pipes at all.

```{r}
library(magrittr)
bench::mark(iterations = 10000,
  `%>%` = cars %>% 
    identity %>%
    identity() %>%
    identity(.) %>%
    {identity(.)},
  `%.%` = cars %.% {
    identity
    identity()
    identity(.)
    {identity(.)}
  },
  `%..%` = cars %..% {
    identity(.)
    identity(.)
    identity(.)
    {identity(.)}
   },
  `base` = {
    . <- cars
    . <- identity(.)
    . <- identity(.)
    . <- identity(.)
    . <- identity(.)
   }
)
```

## Snippets

Runing `setup_nakedpipe_snippets()` will open RStudio's snippet file so you
can add our suggested snippets there. Follow the instructions and you'll be able to type :

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cars . # + 2 time the <tab> key
```

and display : 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cars %.% {
  # with the cursor conveniently placed here
}
```

(or type `..` to get the `%..%` equivalent)

## Similar efforts

*nakedpipe* is heavily inspired by *magrittr* and follows the same dot insertion
rules.

Alternative pipes are available on *CRAN*, at the time of writing and to my knowlege,
in packages *wrapr* and *pipeR*. The latter includes a function `pipeline()` that
allows piping a sequence of calls in a similar fashion as *nakedpipe*
